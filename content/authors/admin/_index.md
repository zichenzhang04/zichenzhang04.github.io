I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate about deep learning models, web technologies and entrepreneurship.

I’m interested in both the academia and the entrepreneurial world. I'm always interested in designing efficient algorithms and methods that handle large amounts of data, and I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Minji Kim](https://www.michiganmedicine.org/profile/10026/minji-kim) and Dr. [Jane Huggins](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/mni/jane-huggins-phd) at the U-M Minji Lab and Direct Brain Interface Lab, respectively. I also co-founded Collage, an EdTech startup to assist students with course scheduling.

Feel free to contact me at zhangzzc@umich.edu. I’m always open to a coffee chat.
