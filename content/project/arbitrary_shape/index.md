title: "Learning Pushing Dynamics for Arbitrary 2D Rigid Bodies"

# subtitle: A Subtitle

summary: <div><p style=color:gray>Art Boyarov*, <b>Zichen Zhang</b>*.</p></div>We study the problem of learning the pushing dynamics of arbitrary 2D rigid bodies, developing neural network models trained on simulated data collected with a Franka Panda robot. By comparing a shallow MLP to a deeper point-cloud-inspired network, we show that the deeper model better captures the complex motion dynamics of different 2D shapes. Using the learned models in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, we successfully achieve closed-loop pushing and obstacle avoidance across diverse 2D rigid bodies.
