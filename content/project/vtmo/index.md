title: "VTMo: Unified Visuo-Tactile Transformer Encoder with Mixture-of-Modality-Experts"

# subtitle: A Subtitle

summary: <div><p style=color:gray><b>Zichen Zhang</b>, Peihao Li, Yuan Cheng.<br></p></div>We introduce VTMo, a modular Vision-Touch Transformer encoder that unifies dual-encoder flexibility with fusion-encoder accuracy through a shared self-attention mechanism and modality-specific/cross-modal experts. VTMo supports image-only, touch-only, and vision-touch fusion tasks, offering versatility for speed or accuracy. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Image-to-Touch Retrieval task while reducing training time and computational complexity.
