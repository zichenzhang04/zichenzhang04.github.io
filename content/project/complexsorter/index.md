title: MIA-Sort

summary: Implemented as a Python library, MIA-Sort is a bioinformatcics software tool for efficiently extracting and sorting chromatin complexes for a given region. Applying MIA-Sort to large Hi-C, ChIA-PET, SPRITE, ChIA-Drop, and Pore-C datasets allows researchers to quantify the strengths of chromatin loops, stripes, and jets that are key to understanding loop extrusion. On multi-way datasets, MIA-Sort can identify chromatin hubs by quickly extracting chromatin contacts involving any number of genomic loci specified by researchers.
