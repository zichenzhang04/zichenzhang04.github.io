title: GenHint
summary: GenHint won the MHacks 2024 Honorable Mention of Best Developer Tool Track. Unlike conventional AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, GenHint does not give you codes directly. Instead, it generates code templates with "TODO" comments and explains each subproblem for you. Download GenHint at VS Code Extensions.
