        <ul>
          <li>My Chinese name is 张紫宸. In Chinese, 'Zi' (紫) means 'purple,' which traditionally represents nobility, elegance, and auspiciousness. 'Chen' (宸) refers to a palace or the residence of an emperor, symbolizing dignity and grandeur. Together, the name 'Zichen' conveys a sense of royalty, grace, and aspiration for greatness.</li>
          <br>
          <li>I was born and raised in <strong>Zhangjiagang</strong>, a small city close to Suzhou, China. I studied at the <a href='https://jslfgz.zjgedu.cn/xxgk/xxjj' target="_blank">Jiangsu Provincial Liangfeng Middle School</a> in China before transferring to <a href='https://ahs.rochester.k12.mi.us/' target="_blank">Rochester Adams High School</a> in Rochester Hills, Michigan. <em>Go Highlanders!</em></li>
          <br>
          <li>I love Chinese calligraphy and I started learning it since elementary school. Please follow me on Instagram to see more of my works!</li>
